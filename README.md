# hello, friend

## this is my personal [homepage](https://casey-a-clowers.netlify.com/)

you'll see me waving and saying 'howdy!'
this was Halloween several years ago

i'm waving via some infinite loop CSS that I wrote

i like to think I have a sense of humor, as evidenced by my humility joke

you might notice a small link called 'smirk' which, when clicked, will scroll the page all the way down to the bottom. there you will see a dashing gif of Ryan Reynolds flashing a smirk

## tech array

i have mapped an array of tech logos to the DOM, showing various technologies to which I have some exposure

## projects

i worked on the Woodland Pizza mobile app with UX Designer Olivia Klavetter. it is written with React Native

the PotatoHeadProject web app was a group effort with [Jimmy Brannon](https://github.com/brannonjames), [Paia Thao](https://github.com/paiathao), and [Toua Thao](https://github.com/TouaThao). it was written with a ReactJS front end and a MongoDB and NodeJS back end

SOL-Cycle was a solo project written in ReactJS and PostgreSQL/Node

## crafts

originally this section, as well as the upcoming Shirts section, were mapped in the same way as the above Tech array

i wrote a reusable react component for use in each section, but decided to implement an image Carousel (because i like image carousels)

this section showcases my various non-techical interests. i am a curious person and always like to learn new things

## shirts

i like to express myself in various ways, and since i'm not always a very verbal person i made these face shirts. they convey various emotions

## the bottom of the page

if you have clicked 'smirk' up at the top, you now have found yourself at the bottom. Under the RR gif, there are two buttons. One will return you to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling action. The other says 'get it?' and will open a new browser tab for the 'self-deprecation' Wikipedia page

i like implementing links (even if they take a few steps to discover)
